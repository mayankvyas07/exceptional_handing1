    "Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions can be errors or other exceptional events that require special handling. They can be caused by various factors such as invalid input, division by zero, or trying to access a non-existent file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: These occur during the execution of a program, indicating that something unexpected has happened. They can be caught and handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: These occur during the parsing of code and indicate that the code is not written according to the language's syntax rules. They prevent the program from running at all until the syntax is corrected.\n",
    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, it leads to program termination and an error message (stack trace) is displayed. This error message provides information about the type of exception, where it occurred, and the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught a ValueError\")\n",
    "In this example, a ZeroDivisionError is raised due to division by zero. However, the except block only catches ValueError, so the ZeroDivisionError is not handled. As a result, the program will terminate and display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to raise and handle exceptions? Explain with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "raise: This statement is used to explicitly raise an exception.\n",
    "try and except: These statements are used together to handle exceptions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "In this example, the try block attempts to perform a division by zero, which raises a ZeroDivisionError. The except block catches the exception and prints an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain with an example: try, except, else, finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "The try, except, else, and finally blocks are used to handle exceptions in a structured way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You entered:\", num)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution completed\")\n",
    "In this example, the try block attempts to convert user input into an integer. If a ValueError occurs, the except block is executed. If no exception occurs, the else block is executed. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions are user-defined exception classes that inherit from the built-in Exception class or its subclasses. They allow you to create your own exception types tailored to your application's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions to provide more meaningful and specific error messages to users, making it easier to identify and handle errors that are unique to our application's domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class NegativeNumberError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        super().__init__(f\"Negative number not allowed: {self.value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a positive number: \"))\n",
    "    if num < 0:\n",
    "        raise NegativeNumberError(num)\n",
    "except NegativeNumberError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception NegativeNumberError. When the user enters a negative number, we raise this custom exception. The custom exception's error message provides specific information about the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Create a custom exception class and use it to handle an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating and using a custom exception class:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"This is a custom exception\")\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught a custom exception:\", e)\n",
    "In this example, we create a custom exception class CustomError. We then raise an instance of this exception using the raise statement and catch it using an except block.\n",
    "\n",
